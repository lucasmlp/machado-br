 I'm a Back-end Engineer with 4 years of professional experience. My strong background is in .NET, Golang and Node.JS (Serveless).

I have experience orchestrating Docker containers with Kubernetes, managing infrastructure as a code with Terraform and managing Kubernetes applications with Helm charts. Also, I have experience working with the GCP and AWS cloud providers. For databases, I've worked with Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
